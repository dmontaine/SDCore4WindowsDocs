# Assign every name BCOMP accepts to exactly one User-set document, and report
# what is unassigned or assigned twice.  The point is that a document set which
# quietly misses a function must fail this rather than look finished.
#
# 3 Nov 26 (S.74, S.129): the table brought up to date - every name BCOMP accepts is assigned to the topic
# page that documents it, and the names BCOMP's five tables do not hold are removed.
# 13 Nov 26 (Windows, RELEASE_1.1 269): carried from SDCore4LinuxDocs 89dd60f, the table here having fallen 105 names
# behind.  Two Windows changes: SILENT is assigned to 02 (BCOMP accepts it since 3 Nov and page 02 documents it beside
# CAPTURING; Linux's table lacks it too, told by mail), and OPENTEMP is left out until RELEASE_1.1 251 carries it.
