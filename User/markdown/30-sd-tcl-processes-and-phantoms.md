Title: SD TCL - Processes and Phantoms
Subtitle: Seeing what a session is doing, running work in the background, and taking a snapshot of a running program.

Every SD session is a process with a **user number**, and almost everything on
this page takes one. The number is not the Windows process id and it is not the
account name: it is SD's own handle on a session, it is reused after a session
ends, and it is what `pstat` and `pdump` both expect.

A **phantom** is a session with no terminal. You start one, it runs a command in
the background under its own user number, and what it would have displayed is
written to a file instead.

SD folds case, so a command may be typed in either case. Commands are shown here
in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and **bold**
marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

> **The listings on this page were produced by running them**, on SD Core for
> Windows W1.0-0. The two exceptions are `phantom` and `pdebug`, and the reason
> is on the page: neither can be driven down a pipe, so both are described from
> their source rather than shown.

## What is not on this page

**Seeing other people's sessions, and ending them, are administrator verbs.**
`listu` lists every session on the machine and `logout` *n* ends one, and
neither is in an ordinary account's VOC. They are documented in the
**administrator documentation**, under *Sessions and Locks*, which is a
separate set your administrator may or may not have given you.

**`logout` with no argument is the exception and every account has it** — it
ends your own session and is `quit` under another name. That is worth knowing
before typing it intending to list something.

What is here is **your own processes**: what this session is doing, work you
started in the background, and how to look at either.

## What a session is doing: `pstat`

```
pstat {user n} {level n} {no.page} {lptr {n}}
```

With no arguments it reports every session; **`user`** *n* restricts it to one.

```
:pstat
User Detail
  27 Account: DON
     Command: pstat
     $PSTAT 141 (262)
  12 (Not responding)
```

Each line under a user number is the account it is in, the command it is
running, and where in that command it currently is — program name, source line,
and the address in hexadecimal.

For a process that is **waiting for a lock**, `pstat` also shows when the wait
began, as `list.readu detail` already did.

### The levels are additive

| | |
|---|---|
| default | the current program only |
| **`level 1`** | the whole **call stack** |
| **`level 2`** | the **internal subroutine** stack — where each `gosub` will return to |
| **`level 3`** | both |

From inside a running program, which is where the levels are worth having —
at the prompt there is nothing on the stack but `pstat` itself:

```
User Detail
  27 Account: DON
     Command: pstat user 27 level 1
     $PSTAT 141 (262)
     Command processor
     /cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/BP.OUT/ZZMATH 34 (152)
     Command processor
```

Read it downwards: `$PSTAT` is running, called by the command processor, which
was reached by `execute` from the program `ZZMATH` at line 34, which the command
processor started. **`level 3` adds an indented line under each frame** for the
`gosub` inside it.

### `(Not responding)` means the process is gone, not busy

`pstat` does not read another session's memory. It **asks** — it posts an event
to the target and waits for the answer, for up to four seconds. A session that
never answers gets that line.

**That is the cheapest way to find a dead session.** A session killed from
outside SD keeps its entry in the user table and its slot is still counted;
`pstat` is what tells you nothing is behind the entry. User 12 in both listings
above is one of those. **Clearing it is an administrator's job** — reporting the
user number is the useful thing you can do.

## Running something in the background: `phantom`

```
phantom command
```

The command is everything after the verb. SD creates a new process, gives it a
user number, and answers at once:

```
Started phantom user 31
```

**Your session does not wait**, and the phantom has no terminal, so anything it
would have displayed goes to a **como** record instead — in the account's
`$COMO` file, named `PH`*n*`_`*ddmmyy*`_`*hhmmss* for the phantom's user number
and start time. `$COMO` is created if the account has not got one. The first
line in the record is the phantom's own banner:

```
Phantom 31 started at 14:22:07 27 Aug 2026
```

so a phantom that produced nothing else is still distinguishable from one that
never started.

| refusal | when |
|---|---|
| *Phantom command missing* | `phantom` with nothing after it |
| *Phantom processes cannot be started within a transaction* | inside `begin transaction` |
| *Failed to create phantom process* | the operating system would not create the process |

> **A phantom cannot be started from a scripted session, and this is the one
> to know.** When SD is fed commands down a pipe, the phantom child inherits
> that pipe. The job then never completes — not even after the parent session
> has exited — and the only way out is to kill the process, which leaves an
> entry in the user table that needs an elevated `sd -cleanup` to clear.
> **`phantom` is for a person at a prompt, or for a program, and not for a
> piped script.** The listings above are quoted from the verb's own message
> texts for that reason.

**A phantom is not a scheduled job.** It runs once, now. Recurring work is a
Windows scheduled task that starts SD, and that is a different subject.

### A phantom that ends with its parent: `phantom group`

```
phantom group command
```

A phantom started with the word `group` is **grouped with the process that started it**:
when that process ends — it logs out, or is logged out — SD logs the grouped phantoms
out too, where an ordinary phantom would go on until its command finished. It is for a helper that has no purpose without you. `listu` shows a
grouped phantom with a **`G`** after its parent's number, and `system(1073)` in the
parent gives the user numbers of the phantoms grouped with it, field mark delimited
(`system(1058)` gives all its child phantoms, grouped or not, and `system(1052)` counts
them). A phantom that has not yet finished starting when its parent ends is still
logged out.

### A phantom with a user number of its own: `phantom user`

```
phantom user n command
```

The phantom is **user number n**. The numbers are the ones the administrator keeps for this
with the `PHANTOMS` parameter of `sd.conf` (`PHANTOMS=900,4` keeps 900 to 903); no session and no
phantom started without `user` is ever given one of them. It is for a service that other
programs find by its user number. `user` may stand beside `no.msg`, `data`, `group` and `log`, in
any order, and `phantom` returns the number as it always does.

| refusal | when |
|---|---|
| *phantom user needs a user number* | `user` with nothing after it, or something that is not a whole number above 0 |
| *user number n is not one of the numbers the phantoms parameter keeps* | `n` is outside `PHANTOMS`, or the administrator has set none |
| *user number n is already in use* | a phantom (or anybody) has it now; no phantom is made |

With `USPLIT=1` the numbers are not kept from other processes, but `user n` still takes a free one.

### `@pstat`: what `pstat` shows about the program

`@pstat` is an `@` variable a program **may assign to**. Whatever text it holds when
another session runs `pstat` (or `pstat user n`) is printed as an extra line under the
process's last command and location, so a long-running program or a phantom can say what
it is doing — `@pstat = 'Posting batch ' : n` — without a terminal to say it on. It is the
program's own text and is not cleared for it.

### A phantom that ends with its parent: `phantom group`

```
phantom group command
```

A phantom started with the word `group` is **grouped with the process that started it**:
when that process ends — it logs out, or is logged out — SD logs the grouped phantoms
out too, where an ordinary phantom would go on until its command finished. It is for a helper that has no purpose without you. `listu` shows a
grouped phantom with a **`G`** after its parent's number, and `system(1073)` in the
parent gives the user numbers of the phantoms grouped with it, field mark delimited
(`system(1058)` gives all its child phantoms, grouped or not, and `system(1052)` counts
them). A phantom that has not yet finished starting when its parent ends is still
logged out.

### `@pstat`: what `pstat` shows about the program

`@pstat` is an `@` variable a program **may assign to**. Whatever text it holds when
another session runs `pstat` (or `pstat user n`) is printed as an extra line under the
process's last command and location, so a long-running program or a phantom can say what
it is doing — `@pstat = 'Posting batch ' : n` — without a terminal to say it on. It is the
program's own text and is not cleared for it.

### What a phantom does not inherit

**A phantom is a new SD process, not a branch of yours.** It is started with
`fork` and `exec` and goes through login of its own, so **nothing your session
holds in memory reaches it** — no `@`-variables, no unnamed common, no open
files, no active select list. **The command string is the only thing passed**,
through a record in SD's `$IPC` file, and the session's option settings go with
it only when the `INHERIT` option is set.

## What phantoms have I started: `status`

```
status
```

```
:status
There are no phantom processes started by this process
```

which is the answer in any session that has not started one. When there are
some, it prints a user number, the start time and the command for each:

```
User  Started            Command
```

**It reports only your own children.** It is not a system-wide view and it is
not `listu` — a phantom somebody else started does not appear, and neither does
one your session started before you `logto`'d somewhere else. The register it
reads is keyed by the parent's user number.

## Every phantom that is running: `list.phantoms`

```
list.phantoms
list.phantoms user name
```

Lists the phantoms, **and no other session**: a header, then a line for each
with its user number, its operating system process id, the login name it runs
as, the time it started and the account it is in (the phantom starts in its
parent's account). `user` *name* shows only that user's (the name is case
sensitive). **The account is shown for the administrator and for your own
phantoms, and left blank for anyone else's**, as `listu` does. **openQM's
`pool` word is refused** (*SD has no pools of phantom processes*), and `user`
without a name is *User name required after USER*.

## Telling a phantom what to do: `child()` and `signal()`

```
child(userno)
signal(userno)
system(1062)
```

`child(userno)` is true if *userno* is a phantom **this process started** and
it is still running; the number is the one `phantom` hands back. Any other
number, and a phantom that has ended, give false.

`signal(userno)` raises a flag in the process with that user number and is true
if that process is logged in; the other process reads and clears it with
`system(1062)`. It is the simple way to ask a phantom to stop:

```
loop
   ... the work ...
until system(1062)
   nap 100
repeat
```

**SD signals only a process of the same login user** (the administrator can
signal any): to a process of another user it gives false and does nothing.
Two signals before the other process reads one are one signal.

## Dumping a process: `pdump`

```
pdump n
```

Writes a snapshot of session *n* to a file and carries on; nothing is stopped
and nothing is lost. The file is `sddump.`*n* in the directory named by the
`DUMPDIR` configuration parameter, or in SD's own system directory when
`DUMPDIR` is empty, which is how it ships:

```
Dumping process state as C:\ProgramData\SD\sdsys/sddump.27
```

It holds the `@`-variables, the current sentence and command, the call stack,
open files and their locks, and named and unnamed common — which is to say **it
holds application data**, and it is written where any SD user can read it.
Treat a dump as you would the data of the program that produced it, and delete
it when the question it was written to answer has been answered.

| refusal | when |
|---|---|
| *User number required* | `pdump` with no number |
| *Not logged in* | no session has that user number |
| *PDUMP not allowed for processes run under other usernames* | the `PDUMP` configuration parameter has bit 1 set and the session is not elevated |

**It is an event, not a call.** `pdump` marks the target and returns; the target
writes the file when it next looks at its event flags. A process that is wedged
somewhere that never checks will not produce one.

## Debugging a phantom: `pdebug`

```
pdebug                  attach to a phantom that is waiting for a debugger
pdebug command          start command as a phantom and attach to it
```

`pdebug` puts the SD debugger on **this** terminal and the program in a
**phantom**, which is the only way to debug something that has no terminal of
its own. With a command it starts the phantom for you; with none it waits for
one to ask for a debugger, and **`Q`** gives up waiting.

It refuses inside a phantom or an API session — *Phantom debugger can only be
executed from an interactive session* — because it needs a terminal to draw the
debugger on.

> **Do not send `pdebug` down a pipe.** It polls the keyboard while it waits,
> and in a piped session the input stream is the script, so it consumes the
> commands that have not run yet. Together with the phantom it starts, that is
> two ways for one verb to hang a scripted session. **It is described here from
> source for exactly that reason.**

The debugger itself — the commands it takes once it is attached — is in
[SD Basic - Debugging](17-sd-basic-debugging.html).

## Who has these verbs

**Every account has `status`, `phantom`, `pstat`, `pdebug` and `pdump`** —
there is no withheld set any more.

**`pdump` still has a gate, and it is not about having the verb.** `pdump`
*n* is yours to use on your own processes; against another Windows
account's process, it refuses unless the session is SDSYS's. `pstat` reports
any session, with no such restriction.
