Title: SD Basic - Debugging
Subtitle: Stopping a program where you want it, and looking at what it thinks is true.

SD has a real source-level debugger. It stops on a line, shows you the source,
prints any variable with its type, changes one, sets breakpoints, watches a
variable for change, and shows the call stack. It is worth ten minutes of
learning and it replaces most of the `crt` statements people leave behind.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

## Nothing works until you compile with DEBUGGING

```
basic bp MYPROG debugging
```

**The `debugging` keyword is what makes every other thing on this page
possible.** Without it the compiler emits no per-line debug information, and
the debugger has nothing to stop on. It shows in three ways:

| | |
|---|---|
| a `debug` statement in a program compiled **without** it | *"WARNING: DEBUG statement ignored - Not compiling in debug mode"*, **0 errors**, and the program **ran straight through** |
| the same program started with the `debug` **verb** | ran straight through — no prompt, no message |
| the same source compiled **with** `debugging` | stopped, and the prompt appeared |

The warning is a warning, not an error: the program compiles and runs. **A
`debug` statement in production code is therefore harmless but useless**, and
the tell that you forgot the keyword is that nothing happens.

**Recompile without `debugging` when you are finished.** The extra information
is per line, and the debugger becomes reachable by anyone who can run the
program.

## Two ways in

```
debug bp MYPROG          ;* the verb: stop on the FIRST line
```

The verb stops before line 1 has run:

```
:DEBUG BP ZZDBG
 1:       crt 'ZZDBG.START'

>
```

```
      debug                ;* the statement: stop where you put it
```

The statement stops on the **next** line, the one that has not run yet:

```
ZZDBG.START
 4:       n = n + 1

>
```

Use the verb when you want the whole program, and the statement when you want a
particular place — inside an `if` that is only true for one record, for
example. The statement is the only way to stop on a condition, because there is
no conditional breakpoint.

`>` is the prompt. `pdebug` is the same debugger for a phantom; the `debug`
verb refuses a phantom outright with *"Cannot debug program in a phantom
process"*.

In `pdebug` an `@variable` you ask for (`/@user0`, `/@tty`) is the value in the
phantom being debugged, not in your own session: the request is sent to the
phantom, which answers with its own. In the phantom `@tty` is `phantom`. The
`@variables` the debugger can show now include `@bpv`, `@conv`, `@ds`,
`@exception` and its three companions, `@file.name`, `@filename`, `@lpv`, `@nd`,
`@ni`, `@ns`, `@nv`, `@option`, `@pstat`, `@seqno`, `@system.set`,
`@transaction.id`, `@transaction.level` and `@trigger.return.code`, as well as
those it showed before.

## The commands, as this port prints them

Typing `help` at the `>` prompt gives:

```
BRK n           Set breakpoint on line n
CLR {n}         Clear all or specific breakpoint
DUMP var path   Dump variable to given pathname
HELP            Display this screen
ABORT or Quit   Abort program
EXit            Exit subroutine
EP              Exit program
Goto n          Goto line n
Run {n}         Free run or to line n
SRC {n}         Display line n, current line if n omitted
SRC {m,n}       Display n lines starting at line n.
STACK           Display call stack
Step .n         Step n debug elements
Step n          Step n lines
STOP            Stop program
Watch var       Watch for changes to named variable
UnWatch         Cancel Watch action
```

**The capital letters are the abbreviation** — `S` for `Step`, `R` for `Run`,
`G` for `Goto`, `W` for `Watch`, `UW` for `UnWatch`, `EX` for `EXit`, `Q` for
`Quit`. `?` is a synonym for `/` below, not for `help`.

## Looking at a variable

```
/name
```

A slash and the name, on three kinds of variable:

```
>/N
Integer: 41

>/K
String (9 bytes): "some text"

>/ARR(1)
String (5 bytes): "first"
```

**The type is part of the answer, and it is often the answer.** `Integer: 41`
and `String (2 bytes): "41"` are different bugs, and so are `Integer: 1` and
`Float: 1.500000`. The rest of the shapes:

| | |
|---|---|
| a variable that has not been assigned yet | `Unassigned` — **not** an empty string |
| a name the program never mentions | `Variable not defined` |
| a floating point variable | `Float: 1.500000` |

The difference between the first two matters: `Unassigned` means the variable
is yours and has no value yet, and *"Variable not defined"* means you have
mistyped the name.

A matrix element takes its subscripts: `/ARR(1)` for one dimension,
`/ARR(2,3)` for two. `/` on its own repeats the last variable you looked at,
printing the same answer again.

```
set name = value
```

changes it. `SET N = 100` then `/N` gives `Integer: 100`, and the program
carries on with the new value.

`dump var path` writes a variable to an operating system file, which is the way
to look at something too long for the screen.

## Stepping and running

| | |
|---|---|
| `s` | one line — the debugger prints the next one, `5:  crt 'ZZDBG.N=' : n` |
| `s `*n* | *n* lines — `s 3` from line 4 lands on line **7** |
| `s .`*n* | *n* debug elements — finer than a line |
| `r` | run on |
| `r `*n* | run on until line *n* |
| `g `*n* | jump to line *n* **without running the lines in between** |
| `ex` | run to the end of this subroutine |
| `ep` | run to the end of this program |
| `stop` | stop the program |
| `q` | abort — prints `ABORT : Debugging terminated` |

An `s` in the middle of an assignment sequence:

```
>/N
Integer: 41

>S
 5:       m = n * 2

>/N
Integer: 42
```

— the step executed line 4, `N` moved from 41 to 42, and the debugger is now
sitting on line 5.

## Breakpoints

```
brk 9        set one on line 9
clr 9        clear that one
clr          clear all of them
```

`brk 9` then `r`:

```
>BRK 9

>R
 9:       crt 'ZZDBG.N=' : n : ' M=' : m : ' K=' : k
```

`src` shows you the line numbers to aim at. `src 1,4`:

```
>SRC 1,4
 1:       crt 'ZZDBG.START'
 2:       n = 41
 3:       debug
 4:       n = n + 1
```

Breakpoints are on a **line number in the source**, so the source record has to
still match the compiled object. The debugger checks the modification time and
refuses with *"Unable to find source record"* if the source has moved on;
recompile rather than trying to work around it.

**There is no conditional breakpoint.** Put a `debug` statement inside the `if`
instead, and recompile.

## Equate tokens

A program compiled with `$mode debug.equates` (and for the debugger, `basic ...
debugging`) keeps its `equate` and `$define` tokens in the object. The
debugger then takes a token for what it stands for, wherever it takes a
variable name:

```
>/cust.name          the variable the token was equated to
>/limit              LIMIT = 100        a $define or an equate of a constant
>set tot = 9         sets the variable behind the token
>w tot > 10          watches it
```

A token equated to a **variable**, an **element of a matrix** or a **field of
a dynamic array variable** shows, `set`s and `watch`es the thing it stands
for. A token of a **number, a string or `char(n)`** is not a variable: it
shows as `name = value`, and `set` and `watch` refuse it with *Variable not
defined*. Without the mode a token is not known to the debugger, as it
never was.

**A token may also be the value** of a `set` (16 Oct 2026): `set tot = numc`
gives the variable the number the token stands for, and a token of a string or
of `char(n)` gives it that. A token of a **variable** is not a value, and is
refused with *Illegal value* as before.

## Every variable, control characters, the size of the screen

**`/*`** shows every variable of the program, one to a line, the name first and
then what `/name` shows: the locals, then the common blocks the program names.
(In the full-screen debugger the lines are paged with *---more---*; the manual's
list you can move about in and open with Return is not built. Use `/name` to go
into an array, a collection or a string.)

**`^`** switches the way a control character in a string is shown: as `?`, as it
always was, or as `^9` (a caret and the decimal number) after the first `^`; a
second `^` puts the `?` back. The length shown does not change.

**`window` *n*** sets the number of rows of the data area (messages and
replies) of the **full-screen** debugger, 5 to 15; the source above it takes
what is left. `window 3` is refused (*The data area must be 5 to 15 lines*) and
in line-by-line mode the command is a format error. A `window` *n* line in the
VOC record **`$debug.options`** (the record that already holds
`no.source.warning`) sets it at the first stop of a session.

**A stop at every `case` condition.** A program compiled for the debugger stops
before each `case` of a `begin case` is tried, so stepping by line shows the
condition being tried (`case x = 1`, then `case x = 2` when that was false) and
not only the statements of the case that was chosen. A condition and a
statement on one line are two elements of the line.

## Watching a variable

```
w m          stop when M changes
uw           stop watching
```

**A watch is the one thing that finds "who is setting this".** A watch set at
line 4, then `r`:

```
>W M

>R
 6:       k = 'some text'
Watched variable M has changed
Integer: 84
```

It ran on, and stopped **after** the line that changed `M`, telling you what it
changed to. That is the whole answer to the commonest hard bug in a long
program.

There is **one** watch at a time; `w` on another variable replaces it.

### Stopping only for a value

```
w n > 7
w s = stop
w code matches '3a0n'
```

`w` *variable* *operator* *value* stops only when the value just assigned meets
the condition; otherwise the program goes on and the debugger shows nothing.
The operators are `=` `#` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`, the words `eq` `ne` `lt` `gt` `le`
`ge`, and `matches`. A value in quotes is that text; a number compares as a
number and anything else as text. With `n` set to 1 to 10 in a loop, `w n > 7`
stops three times, for 8, 9 and 10.

A plain `w n` stops at every assignment as before, a new `w` replaces the old
watch **and its condition**, and `uw` clears both. An operator that is not in
the list, or no value after it, gives *Unrecognised command* and watches
nothing. `like` and `unlike` are not supported. The variable is found by its
number in the program that set the watch, so a condition on a local variable
works while that program is the one running.

## The call stack

```
stack
```

From inside a program run from the command prompt:

```
>STACK
1: /cygdrive/c/ProgramData/SD/user_accounts/don/BP.OUT/ZZDBG @ 9
Command processor
```

The object path and the line, then whatever called it. From a program a
program can ask the same question without the debugger:

| | |
|---|---|
| `system(1002)` | the call stack as a dynamic array — one field per level |
| `system(1029)` | internal subroutine depth — `0` at the top, `1` inside a `gosub` |

## It is a line-mode debugger here, and that is not a limitation of your terminal

**On this port the debugger never draws a full screen.** Its own test is
`terminfo('sreg')`, and `sreg` — *save screen region* — is a capability of SD's
own client terminals, not of a console. In a session on the shipped `windows`
terminal type:

| | |
|---|---|
| `terminfo('sreg')` | **0 characters** |
| `terminfo('cup')` | 16 characters |
| `terminfo('clear')` | 6 characters |

So cursor addressing is there and the region capability is not, and the
debugger takes its line-oriented path. **Nothing is lost** — every command
works, as the transcripts on this page show — and there is a real gain: because
it is line-oriented it can be **driven from a script**. A whole debugging
session can be fed down a pipe.

`@tty` reads empty in a piped session, and the debugger works there anyway.

## Who has it

Read out of an account's own VOC:

| VOC entry | record | |
|---|---|---|
| `debug` | a `V` verb, `IN`, internal command 29 | run a program in debug mode |
| `debugging` | a `K` keyword, 53 | the compiler keyword |
| `pdebug` | a `V` verb, `CA $PDEBUG` | the phantom debugger |

**Every account has `debug` and `pdebug`** — there is no longer a tier that
would withhold them. `debugging` is a keyword rather than a verb, and always
was available regardless.

## What is not here

**`trace` is gone.** It was removed from the compiler in July 2024. In an
ordinary account it is *"Unrecognised statement"*.

**The programmatic debug statements are restricted.** `debug.on`,
`debug.off`, `debug.set`, `breakpoint` and `watch` are internal-only, and all
five are *"Unrecognised statement"* in an ordinary account. They are
what the debugger itself is built from. **`debug` — the plain statement — is
not restricted**, and it is the one you want.

`debug.info()` is internal-only for the same reason.

**No conditional breakpoints, no data breakpoints beyond the single watch, and
no remote attach.** The debugger runs in the session that runs the program.
