Title: SD Dictionaries - Formats and Expressions
Subtitle: Format specifications, I-type expressions, correlatives, and chaining conversions.

This page continues [SD Dictionaries - Conversions and
Formatting](34-sd-dicts-conversions.html).

## Format specifications — field 5

Field 5 controls how the query processor lays out the column. It is also
the argument to the BASIC `FMT()` function, and the syntax is the same.

```
{length} {fill.char} justification {decimal_places} {options}
```

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| *length* | field width in characters |
| *fill.char* | a quoted character to pad with (defaults to space) |
| justification | `L`, `R`, `T`, `C` or `U` |
| *decimal_places* | number of decimal places (0-9) |
| *scale_factor* | a second digit — the scale factor |

### Justification

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `L` | left-justified |
| `R` | right-justified |
| `T` | text — left-justified, wrapping at word boundaries |
| `C` | centred |
| `U` | left-justified, unchanged — no trimming |

### Numeric options

After the justification, a format can carry these flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `$` | prefix with the currency symbol |
| `,` | insert thousands separators |
| `Z` | suppress zero — print nothing for zero |
| `B` | blank if negative — print spaces for a negative number |
| `C` | suffix `CR` for negative, blank for positive |
| `D` | suffix `DB` for negative, blank for positive |
| `E` | enclose negative in angle brackets |
| `M` | suffix minus for negative |
| `N` | prefix minus for negative |

### Examples

| Format | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `10L` | `hello` | `hello     ` |
| `10R` | `123` | `       123` |
| `10R2` | `1234.5` | `   1234.50` |
| `10R2,` | `1234567.89` | `1,234,567.89` |
| `10R2$` | `1234.5` | `  $1234.50` |
| `8L#` | `hello` | `###hello` |
| `20T` | long text | wrapped at 20 characters |
| `10RZ` | `0` | (empty) |

### Date shortcut — D in the format field

If the format field begins with `D`, it is not a format at all — it is a
date conversion. `D2[DD/MM/YY]` in field 5 does the same as putting the
same string in field 3. This is a convenience: a D-type record can carry
its date conversion in either field.

### How conversion and format interact

**Conversion (field 3) and format (field 5) are applied in sequence:**
the conversion transforms the stored value first, then the format
controls how the converted value is laid out in the column.

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| 1. Stored value | the raw data from the record field |
| 2. Conversion (field 3) | transforms the value — date formatting, numeric masking, case conversion, translation lookup |
| 3. Format (field 5) | controls width, justification, padding, and numeric display options |

A date field stores an internal date (days since 31 Dec 1967). The
conversion `D2[DD/MM/YY]` turns `20899` into `29/08/26`. The format
`10L` left-justifies it in a 10-character column. Both are needed: the
conversion makes the value readable, the format makes the column
neat.

> **A format cannot convert.** If the format field begins with `D`,
> it is a date conversion, not a format — see above. But a format that
> begins with a digit, `L`, `R`, `T`, `C` or `U` is always a layout
> specification and never transforms the data. If you need the data
> transformed, put the conversion in field 3.

When both fields are present, the conversion runs first and the format
is applied to the converted result. When only the format is present, it
is applied to the raw stored value. When only the conversion is present,
the converted value is printed with a default format — the query
processor works out a width from the data.

### Combined examples

Every row below was run on W1.0-0 and shows what came back, including the
trailing spaces the format adds.

| Field 3 (conversion) | Field 5 (format) | Stored value | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| `D2/` | `10L` | `20899` | `03/20/25  ` |
| `D` | `12L` | `20899` | `20 MAR 2025 ` |
| `MD2` | `10R2,` | `1234567` | ` 12,345.67` |
| `MD2,` | (none) | `1234567` | `12,345.67` |
| `MCU` | `10L` | `hello` | `HELLO     ` |
| `MCT` | (none) | `hello there world` | `Hello There World` |
| (none) | `10R` | `123` | `       123` |
| `MX` | `8R` | `255` | `      FF` |
| `MB` | (none) | `5` | `101` |

Three of these are worth reading twice.

**Internal date 20899 is 20 March 2025.** Day zero is 31 December 1967, so an
internal date does not correspond to anything you can guess.

**`D2/` produces `03/20/25` — month first.** The bare `D` conversion produces
`20 MAR 2025`, with the month abbreviated in capitals. If you want day first,
say so in the conversion rather than relying on a default.

**`MD2` scales rather than truncating.** `MD2` on 1234567 is `12345.67`, not
`1234.56` — the digit count says where the decimal point goes, and no digits
are lost.

## I-type expressions — field 2 for type I

When the dictionary record is type `I`, field 2 is not a field number —
it is an expression. The expression is compiled and executed for each
record the query processor lists, and the result is the field value.

### What the expression can contain

An I-type expression is a single SD BASIC expression. It can use:

- **Field references**: `F2` is field 2 of the current record. `@RECORD`
  is the whole record as a dynamic array.
- **Pseudo-variables**: `@ID` (the record id), `@NI` (number of values
  in the longest multivalued field), `@NB` (record length), `@FILE.NAME`,
  `@USER.NO`, `@PATH`.
- **BASIC functions**: `LEN()`, `FIELD()`, `INDEX()`, `COUNT()`,
  `SUM()`, `OCONV()`, `ICONV()`, `DATE()`, `TIME()`, `RAISE()`,
  `DOWNCASE()`, `UPCASE()`, `TRIM()`, `STR()`, `SPACE()`, `SEQ()`,
  `CHAR()`, `ABS()`, `INT()`, `MOD()`, `SQRT()`, `TRANS()` and the rest.
- **Links**: `TTL%TITLE` is the item `TITLE` of the file that the L-type record
  `TTL` of this dictionary names, for the record that its id expression gives.
  It can stand anywhere a field can, in a function or a concatenation:
  `UPCASE(TTL%AUTHOR)`, `COPY : "/" : TTL%TITLE`. A link to a link is written
  `OUT%TTL%TITLE`. See the L record on [SD Dictionaries - Structure](33-sd-dicts-structure.html);
  a link is worked out when the I-type is compiled.
- **Subroutine calls**: `SUBR("name", arg, ...)` invokes a catalogued
  subroutine. The `FTYPE` I-type in `voc.dic` calls `SUBR("!FTYPE",
  DATA.NAME)`.
- **Conditional expressions**: `IF` *condition* `THEN` *value* `ELSE`
  *value*. The `FTYPE` I-type is
  `IF DATA.NAME # '' THEN SUBR("!FTYPE",DATA.NAME) ELSE ''`.

### What the expression cannot contain

An I-type expression cannot use:

- **Statements**: no `OPEN`, `READ`, `WRITE`, `PRINT`, `INPUT`, `FOR`,
  `LOOP`, `GOTO`, `GOSUB`.
- **Multiple statements**: no semicolons between statements. The whole
  field 2 is one expression. The one exception is a `$MODE` prefix, below.
- **Dimensioned arrays**: no `DIM`, no `MAT`.
- **Common blocks**: no `COMMON`.

If you need any of these, write a subroutine, catalogue it, and call it
with `SUBR()` from the I-type.

### Compiler modes: `$MODE`

An I-type may begin with `$MODE`, a list of mode names and a semicolon, as a program begins with
`$MODE`:

```
$MODE COUNT.OVERLAP ; COUNT(F1, 'aa')
$MODE INDEX.OVERLAP,NOCASE.STRINGS ; INDEX(F1, 'AA', 3)
```

| mode | |
|---|---|
| `INDEX.OVERLAP` · `COUNT.OVERLAP` | `INDEX()` takes the *n*th occurrence counting the ones that overlap, and `COUNT()` finds occurrences that overlap: `aa` in `aaaaaaaaa` is found 8 times, not 4 |
| `CHANGE.NO.OVERLAP` | `CHANGE()` counts occurrences without overlap: when a starting occurrence is given, the ones before it are passed over whole |
| `NOCASE.STRINGS` | string comparisons and the string functions ignore case |
| `TIME.MS` | `TIME()` returns the seconds since midnight to the millisecond, as a number with a fraction |
| `COMPATIBLE.APPEND` | accepted, and does nothing: an I-type has no append to change |

These are the same modes, with the same meanings, as in
[SD Basic - Program Structure](01-sd-basic-program-structure.html).

Several names may be separated by commas, several `$MODE` statements may each end in a semicolon,
and a name with a minus in front of it turns that mode off again (`COUNT.OVERLAP,-COUNT.OVERLAP`).
**Each mode gives the value a program gives with the same `$MODE`**; without the mode the same
expression gives its ordinary value.

Any other mode is refused, and the message names it: *UV.LOCATE is not a mode that an I-type can use*
(message 11395). **An I-type that another I-type uses cannot set modes** (message 11396), because
the one that uses it would be compiled with modes it had not asked for.

### Compilation and the stamp

The expression is compiled to p-code the first time it is used after it
is written or edited. The object is stored in field 16 onward, and a
hash of the source is stored in field 15. When a query opens the
dictionary, it compares the hash to the current source — if they differ,
the I-type is recompiled.

**Editing the expression invalidates the object.** You do not need to
do anything to trigger recompilation — the next query that reads the
field does it. If the expression has a syntax error, the query reports
it and the field appears empty.

### I-type and conversion

An I-type record can have both an expression (field 2) and a conversion
code (field 3). The expression runs first, producing a value, and the
conversion is then applied to that value. An I-type that returns an
internal date with `D` in field 3 will display it formatted — the
expression computes the date, the conversion formats it.

## Correlatives — field 8 for type A

A-type records carry a correlative in field 8. A correlative is a
Pick-style expression — a short code that transforms the field value
before display. SD compiles correlatives the same way it compiles
I-types, storing the object in field 16 onward.

Correlative codes are a Pick inheritance and are rarely used in new SD
dictionaries. An I-type expression is easier to read and can express
calculations a correlative string cannot. The correlative mechanism exists so
that dictionaries imported from Pick systems continue to work.

## Chaining conversions

A conversion code can contain multiple conversions chained with value
marks (char 253). Each is applied in turn to the result of the previous
one. This is how a dictionary field can extract a substring, translate
it, and format it in one pass — the value mark separates the steps.

## Input and output conversion

The same conversion code works for both `OCONV()` (output) and
`ICONV()` (input), but not every code is meaningful in both directions.
`MCL` converts to lower case on output; on input it does the same.
`D2[DD/MM/YY]` formats a date on output; on input it parses one. `MX`
converts to hex on output; on input it converts from hex.

Some codes are output-only or input-only. `B64` encodes on output and
decodes on input. `P(xx)` is a pattern test — it returns the original
value or null on output, and accepts or rejects on input.
