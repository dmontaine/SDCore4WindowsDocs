Title: SD Basic - String Functions
Subtitle: Measuring, finding, extracting, trimming, building and changing the case of text.

This page covers the functions that work on a string as text. The functions
that work on a string as a **structure** — fields, values and subvalues held
together by marks — are in [SD Basic - Dynamic Arrays](05-sd-basic-dynamic-arrays.html), and the ones that
convert between internal and external form are in
[SD Basic - Data Conversion](06-sd-basic-data-conversion.html). The line between the three is not always obvious,
so each page points at the others where they meet.

SD folds case, so a program may be written in either case. Keywords are shown
here in lower case. In the tables, *italics* mark something you supply and
**bold** marks a word typed as it stands; braces mark an optional part.

## Strings, and what counts as a character

Everything in SD is a string. There is no separate character type and no
length declaration — a variable holds as much as you put in it.

**The mark characters are ordinary characters to every function on this
page.** `@fm`, `@vm` and `@sm` occupy one byte each and are counted, indexed,
extracted and replaced like any other:

```
len(1 : @vm : 2)      ;* 3 - the two digits and the mark between them
len(@fm)              ;* 1
```

That is convenient when you want it and a trap when you do not. A `len()` used
to size a display field will include the marks; an `index()` searching for a
character may find one inside a mark-delimited structure you did not mean to
look at. Where you want structure rather than text, use the dynamic-array
functions.

Case conversion leaves marks alone: `upcase(@vm)` is still `@vm`.

## Measuring and counting

```
len(string)
count(string, substring)
dcount(string, delimiter)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `len()` | the number of characters. `len('hello')` is `5`, `len('')` is `0` |
| `count()` | how many times *substring* occurs |
| `dcount()` | how many **fields** *delimiter* divides the string into — normally one more than `count()` |

### The difference in practice

| Expression | Result | |
|---|---|---|
| `count('a,b,c', ',')` | `2` | two delimiters |
| `dcount('a,b,c', ',')` | `3` | three fields |
| `dcount('a,,c', ',')` | `3` | the empty middle field still counts |
| `dcount('a', ',')` | `1` | no delimiter, one field |
| `dcount('', ',')` | **`0`** | **not 1** |
| `count('aaaa', 'aa')` | `2` | matches do not overlap |

> **`dcount()` of an empty string is zero, not one.** Everywhere else an
> empty string behaves like a single empty field, so `for i = 1 to dcount(x,
> @fm)` is the correct idiom precisely **because** it does nothing when `x` is
> empty. Code that assumes at least one field and indexes `field(x, ',', 1)`
> without checking will read an empty value rather than fail.

> **`count()` does not count overlapping matches.** `count('aaaa', 'aa')` is
> `2`, not `3`: once a match is taken, scanning resumes after it. This matters
> when the substring can overlap itself.

*Delimiters may be more than one character* — `dcount('a::b', '::')` is `2`.

## Finding a position

```
index(string, substring, occurrence)
```

Returns the character position at which the *occurrence*-th appearance of
*substring* starts, or `0` if there is no such occurrence. **The occurrence
argument is not optional.**

| Expression | Result |
|---|---|
| `index('banana', 'an', 1)` | `2` |
| `index('banana', 'an', 2)` | `4` |
| `index('banana', 'an', 3)` | `0` — there is no third |
| `index('banana', 'z', 1)` | `0` |
| `index('banana', 'an', 0)` | `0` |

Because a miss and a zeroth occurrence both return `0`, and position `0` is not
a valid position, a simple `if index(...) then` is a safe test for "was it
found".

### `col1()` and `col2()`

```
col1()
col2()
```

After a `field()` call, these give the positions **either side** of the field
that was extracted: `col1()` is the position of the delimiter before it and
`col2()` the position of the delimiter after it.

For `field('alpha,beta,gamma', ',', 2)`, which returns `beta`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `col1()` | `6` — the comma before `beta` |
| `col2()` | `11` — the comma after it |

For the first field `col1()` is `0`, since nothing precedes it. **When the
field is not found, both are `0`** — which is also what they read before any
`field()` has been called, so they cannot distinguish "not found" from "not
asked". Test the result of `field()` itself.

> **`col1()` and `col2()` belong to the running program**, and every called
> program starts with both at zero. A subroutine that calls `field()` changes
> its own pair, not the caller's.

## Extracting part of a string

### By position

The substring operator takes a start and a length:

```
string[start, length]
```

| Expression on `'abcdefgh'` | Result | |
|---|---|---|
| `s[2, 3]` | `bcd` | |
| `s[2, 99]` | `bcdefgh` | a length past the end is not an error |
| `s[9, 2]` | *empty* | a start past the end gives nothing |
| `s[0, 3]` | `abc` | a start below 1 is treated as 1 |
| `s[-3, 2]` | `ab` | so is a negative start |

**The one-argument form is the rightmost characters, not the character at
that position.**

```
s[3]        ;* fgh - the last three characters of 'abcdefgh'
```

This reads like an array subscript and is not one. It is the commonest
misreading of SD BASIC by someone arriving from another language.

**The substring form can also be assigned to**, replacing that stretch in
place:

```
z = 'a,b,c'
z[2,1] = 'Z'      ;* z is now 'aZb,c'
```

### By delimiter

```
field(string, delimiter, occurrence {, count})
fieldstore(string, delimiter, start, count, replacement)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `field()` | returns the *occurrence*-th delimited field. With *count*, returns that many fields **including their delimiters** |
| `fieldstore()` | replaces *count* fields starting at *start*. **A *count* of zero inserts instead of replacing** |

| Expression | Result |
|---|---|
| `field('a,b,c', ',', 2)` | `b` |
| `field('a,b,c', ',', 2, 2)` | `b,c` |
| `field('a,b,c', ',', 9)` | *empty* |
| `fieldstore('a,b,c', ',', 2, 1, 'X')` | `a,X,c` — replaced |
| `fieldstore('a,b,c', ',', 2, 0, 'X')` | `a,X,b,c` — inserted |

An *occurrence* below 1 is treated as 1.

`substrings(array, start, length)` applies the substring operator to **every
element** of a dynamic array: `substrings('abcd' : @vm : 'efgh', 2, 3)` gives
`bcd` and `fgh`.

## Trimming

```
trim(string)
trimb(string)
trimf(string)
trim(string, character {, mode})
```

The one-argument forms work on spaces:

| Expression on `'  a  b  '` | Result |
|---|---|
| `trim()` | `a b` — leading, trailing **and** repeated inner spaces |
| `trimb()` | `  a  b` — trailing only |
| `trimf()` | `a  b  ` — leading only |

The three-argument form works on any character and takes a mode letter. **All
nine, on `'xxaxxbxx'` trimming `x`:**

| Mode | Meaning | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **a** | remove every occurrence | `ab` |
| **b** | leading and trailing only | `axxb` |
| **c** | compress repeats, leave the ends | `xaxbx` |
| **d** | as `trim()` — spaces, both ends and compressed inside | — |
| **e** | as `trimb()` — trailing spaces | — |
| **f** | as `trimf()` — leading spaces | — |
| **l** | leading only | `axxbxx` |
| **t** | trailing only | `xxaxxb` |
| **r** | both ends **and** compress repeats inside | `axb` |

**Omitting the mode gives `r`**, not `b`: `trim(t, 'x')` is `axb`. If you only
want the ends stripped, you must say `'b'` — this is the difference between
`a  b` and `a b` on real data and it is easy to miss.

Modes `d`, `e` and `f` ignore the character argument entirely and act on
spaces, so the character you pass with them is never read.

**For every other mode the character must not be empty.** A null second
argument stops the program with *"Null string as second argument to TRIM()"* —
so a `trim(x, sep)` where *sep* came from data needs checking before the call,
not after.

### `crop()`

```
crop(string)
```

Removes **trailing empty fields, values and subvalues** — the debris left by
deleting the last element of a dynamic array. `crop()` of a value list `a`,
`b`, empty, empty gives just `a`, `b`. It does not touch spaces.

## Building strings

```
space(count)
str(string, count)
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `space()` | *count* spaces. `space(0)` is empty |
| `str()` | *string* **repeated** *count* times |

> **`str()` repeats, it does not pad.** `str('ab', 3)` is `ababab`, six
> characters, not `ab ` padded to three. To pad, concatenate `space()` and take
> a substring, or use `fmt()` — see [SD Basic - Data Conversion](06-sd-basic-data-conversion.html). `str('ab', 0)`
> is empty.

Strings are joined with the `:` operator, and `:=` appends in place:

```
line = 'a' : ',' : 'b'
line := ',c'
```

`cats(array1, array2)` joins two dynamic arrays **element by element** rather
than end to end, and `splice(array1, string, array2)` does the same with a
separator between each pair:

| Expression on `a`,`b` and `1`,`2` | Result |
|---|---|
| `cats(p, q)` | `a1` and `b2` |
| `splice(p, '-', q)` | `a-1` and `b-2` |

## Changing case

```
upcase(string)
downcase(string)
swapcase(string)
```

| Expression on `'aBc1'` | Result |
|---|---|
| `upcase()` | `ABC1` |
| `downcase()` | `abc1` |
| `swapcase()` | `AbC1` |

Digits, punctuation and mark characters are left alone.

> **`fold()` is not a case function.** Despite the name it wraps text into
> lines — see *Wrapping text into lines* below. The case-insensitive
> comparison people reach for `fold` expecting is `compare()` or, for whole
> files, the no-case file option described under [SD Basic - File Handling](07-sd-basic-file-handling.html).

## Ends of a string, and the last element: `left`, `right`, `last`

```
left(string, n)
right(string, n)
last(string, delimiter)
lasts(array, delimiter)
```

`left(s, n)` is `s[1, n]` and `right(s, n)` is `s[n]` (its last *n* characters,
shortened if the string is shorter). A count under 1 is taken as 1 by `left()`
and as 0 by `right()`. `last(s, d)` is the final element of a string delimited
by *d*, which is `field(s, d, dcount(s, d))`; `lasts()` does it to each element
of a dynamic array.

## Testing one character: the `is.` functions

```
is.alnum(s)   is.alpha(s)   is.digit(s)
is.graph(s)   is.mark(s)    is.space(s)
```

Each is true if the **first character** of the argument is a letter or digit,
a letter, a digit, a printing character, one of the mark characters, or white
space. **A null string is false** for all six. They look at one character: a
test of a whole string is `matches`.

## Changing part of a delimited string: `groupstore`

```
groupstore new in string using i, n {, delimiter}
```

A statement for what `string = fieldstore(string, delimiter, i, n, new)` does:
it replaces *n* delimited elements of *string*, from the *i*th, with the
elements of *new*. A position under 1 is taken as 1; a string with fewer
elements than *i* gets delimiters to make up the number. With a positive *n*,
*n* elements are replaced and *new* is padded with delimiters or cut to fit;
with zero or a negative *n*, nothing is deleted (zero) or that many are, and
the whole of *new* goes in. The delimiter is a field mark if it is left out.
With `s = '1*2*3*4*5'`:

| Statement | `s` becomes |
|---|---|
| `groupstore 'A*B' in s using 2, 3, '*'` | `1*A*B**5` |
| `groupstore 'A*B*C' in s using 2, 3, '*'` | `1*A*B*C*5` |
| `groupstore 'A*B*C*D' in s using 2, 3, '*'` | `1*A*B*C*5` |
| `groupstore 'A*B' in s using 2, 0, '*'` | `1*A*B*2*3*4*5` |
| `groupstore 'A*B' in s using 2, -3, '*'` | `1*A*B*5` |

*string* may be an element of an array, as `a(2)`.

## Message digests: `md5()` and `digest()`

```
md5(string)
digest(string, is.file, mode)
```

`md5` gives the 32 hexadecimal characters of the string's MD5 digest. `digest`
does the same for **`MD5`, `SHA1`, `SHA256`, `SHA384` and `SHA512`** (the mode in
either case), and with *is.file* true the string is the pathname of a file and
the file's contents are what is digested, read a block at a time, so a large file
is fine. The result is lower case hexadecimal, the same form as `md5`, and
`status()` is `0`; **on any failure the result is the null string and `status()`
says why**:

| status | |
|---|---|
| `1` | the mode is not one of those five (this includes openQM's `MD4`, which is broken and which OpenSSL 3 no longer provides by default) |
| `3003` | no such file |
| `3035` | the file is outside what the session may reach: a network (API) session is held to its containment, as for `openseq`; a local session is limited only by Windows. An `$internal` program is exempt |
| `1008` | not a regular file (a directory, say), or it could not be read (Windows refused it, for one) |

A digest is not a way to store a password: use the system's login. It is for
checking that a file or a string is what it should be.

## `swapmarks()`

```
swapmarks(string)
```

Gives back **the string as it is.** openQM's function exchanges the mark characters with
accented letters on a system running in ECS (extended character set) mode, and since its
release 3.0-2 returns the data unchanged on any other. SD has no ECS mode, so the
function exists only so that a program that calls it compiles and runs: it never changes a byte.
