Title: Programming with a Remote File
Subtitle: What a program can do with a file on another SD server, and what it is told when it is refused.

A file on another SD server is opened by a VOC entry of type `N`. A program opens it by the VOC name and uses it like a local file, with the differences on this page. **Whether you may is not the program's business:** the administrator of your machine defines the server and your account's place on it, the administrator of the other machine decides whether your remote login may change anything, and a program that is refused is told so in the ways below. Setting it all up is in the *Administrator* set, in the SDNet page; this page is for the person who writes the program.

**On Windows this client has been compiled and its free checks pass; it has not yet been run against another server.** Nothing on this page was seen to happen on a Windows machine. The Linux version of the client was run in test sandboxes and on one installation talking to itself; those results are Linux's.

## Opening it

```
N
nfa
customers
```

Field 2 is the server's name as the administrator defined it, field 3 is the file's name on that server (lower case; up to 63 letters, digits and `. _ - $`). An id is 1 to 63 characters; a longer one is refused on your machine before anything is sent. A program cannot make this entry unless its account has the `voc.edit` switch.

```
OPEN 'customers' TO f ELSE CRT 'no such remote file, STATUS() ':STATUS() ; STOP
OPEN 'DICT', 'customers' TO d ELSE ...        ;* the dictionary of the remote file, from the same server
```

`LIST`, `COUNT`, `SORT`, `SELECT`, `SSELECT`, `LIST.ITEM` and `LIST DICT` work on the VOC name, with the dictionary read from the server. Each record a query needs is one request to the server, so a query over a big file is a round trip per record.

## What the statements do

| | A read-only definition | A `write` definition, and the remote login has the write group |
|---|---|---|
| `READ`, `READV`, `MATREAD`, `SELECT`, `SSELECT`, `FILEINFO`, `CLOSE` | work | work |
| `WRITE`, `WRITEU`, `MATWRITE`, `WRITEV`, `WRITEVU`, `DELETE`, `DELETEU`, `CLEARFILE` | refused, **nothing is sent** | one request each, done on the server |
| `READU`, `READL`, `READVU`, `RECORDLOCKU`, `RECORDLOCKL`, `RELEASE` | refused, nothing is sent | work; a busy record takes the `LOCKED` clause |
| `FILELOCK`, `FILEUNLOCK` | refused, nothing is sent | work; a busy file takes the `LOCKED` clause; `FILEUNLOCK` leaves `STATUS()` 0, 3011 or 3012 (below) |
| `RECORDLOCKED()` | refused, **nothing is sent** (message 12506) | works: the other machine says |
| `GETLOCKS()` (internal programs only) | works, **the local view only** (below) | works, the same |
| inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION` | reads work | reads work, and so does `RECORDLOCKED()` (it changes nothing); a change or a lock (`FILELOCK` and `FILEUNLOCK` too) is refused: a remote write cannot be rolled back |
| `WRITE ... CREATING.SEQKEY`, `FCONTROL`, `CONFIGURE.FILE`, `ANALYSE.FILE`, `CREATE.INDEX`, `BUILD.INDEX`, `DELETE.INDEX`, `DISABLE.INDEX`, `CREATE.FILE ... SERVER`, `DELETE.FILE` of a pointer | refused, nothing is sent | work **only if the remote login also has the administration group** (below, *Administering a remote file*) |
| `INDICES()`, `SELECTINDEX`, `SETLEFT`, `SETRIGHT`, `SELECTLEFT`, `SELECTRIGHT` | work: they ask the other machine's indices (below, *Indices of a remote file*) | work, the same: no gate beyond opening the file |
| `OPENSEQ` and the other sequential-file statements, the statements that read or change an index's tree (`AKREAD`, `AKWRITE`, `AKDELETE`, `CLEAR.AK`, `AKENABLE`, `AKMAP`) | refused (message 12516) | refused (message 12516) |

Two things have to be true for a change to be made, a lock to be taken or `RECORDLOCKED()` to be asked, and they are on **two different machines**: the definition on *your* machine says `write` (the administrator of your machine chose that), and the remote login you use is also in the other machine's write group (the administrator of *that* machine chose that, with `modify.account <account> files-write-on`). Either one missing is a refusal, and the program can tell which (below). A definition that says `write` is looked up again at every change, so an administrator who switches it to `read` stops writes through a handle that is already open. **Administering the file is a third thing**, with its own group on the other machine (below).

## What a refused program sees

Write `ON ERROR` after the statement and read `STATUS()`; without it the program stops with a message.

| What happened | With `ON ERROR` | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| your definition says `read` | `STATUS()` is 7000 | message 12506, "The file on server `s` is read only: write is refused.  Nothing was sent" |
| the other machine's login lacks the write group | `STATUS()` is 7000 | message 12505 with the other machine's own reason: "Server `s` answered write with an error: This login cannot change or lock files here: ask the administrator for files-write-on (request 16)" |
| the remote login has the write group but **not the administration group**, and the statement administers the file | `STATUS()` is 7000 | message 12505 with the other machine's words: "Server `s` answered fcontrol with an error: This login cannot administer files here: ask the administrator for files-admin-on (request 71)" (the request is 68, 69, 70 or 71) |
| the connection is lost while a change is in flight | `STATUS()` is 7000 | message 12514: it is not known whether the change was made. **The change is never sent again.** Open the file again and read the record to find out |
| a change or lock inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION` | `STATUS()` is 7000 | message 12515 |
| `MUSTLOCK` is set and the record is not locked | `STATUS()` is 3023 | as for a local file |
| `MUSTLOCK` is set and the other machine's login lacks the write group | `STATUS()` is 7000 (the check "do I hold the lock?" is itself refused, see `RECORDLOCKED()` below) | message 12505, "request 34"; nothing is written |
| `RECORDLOCKED()` of a file whose definition says `read` | (the function has no `ON ERROR`) | message 12506, "recordlocked is refused", nothing sent |
| the id is empty | the `ELSE` branch, `STATUS()` 3000 | as for a local file |

The other machine's text in message 12505 is cut at 100 characters and anything that is not a printable character is dropped. A reply with no text is shown as `status n`. The same holds for a `SELECT` of a remote file whose answer is such an error: it is message 12505 with the other machine's words.

## Locks

`READU`, `READVU`, `RECORDLOCKU` and `FILELOCK` on something that is busy take the `LOCKED` clause, and `STATUS()` is the **user number of the session that holds it on the other machine** (the same number its `LIST.READU` shows). With no `LOCKED` clause the statement asks again every quarter of a second until the lock is free, so it costs about four requests a second, **the break key ends the wait**, and **two machines cannot see a deadlock between them**. The other machine is never asked to wait: it is always asked "can I have it now?", so a long wait cannot be mistaken for a lost connection. Locks belong to the connection: closing the file variable releases the locks taken through it (a file lock too), `RELEASE f` and a bare `RELEASE` give back a file lock as they do on a local file, and ending the process or a `LOGTO` releases them all.

**`FILELOCK f`** locks the whole file: nobody else can take a read or update lock on any record of it, or a file lock, until you give it back. It is busy when another user holds the file lock **or any record lock in the file**, and then `STATUS()` is that user's number. It takes **two things**, the same two as a write: your definition says `write`, and the remote login is in the other machine's write group. Without the second, the other machine refuses it (message 12526). **`FILEUNLOCK f`** leaves `STATUS()` set the way it is for a local file: **0** the lock was yours and is free now, **3011** another user holds it (it stays theirs), **3012** nobody held it. Neither is allowed inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION` (message 12515); openQM lets them through without a rollback, SDNet does not.

**`RECORDLOCKED(f, id)`** asks the other machine and gives the code a local file gives: **-3** another user holds a file lock, **-2** an update lock, **-1** a read lock; **0** nobody; **1**, **2**, **3** this session holds a read lock, an update lock or the file lock. `STATUS()` afterwards is the lock owner's user number on that machine (0 when nothing is held). **It needs the same two things as a lock:** a `write` definition on your machine and the remote login in the other machine's write group. A `read` definition stops the program with message 12506 ("recordlocked is refused") and nothing is sent; a login without the write group is refused by the other machine, and the program stops with message 12505 and that machine's words, which end "(request 34)". The function has no `ON ERROR` clause, so a refusal always stops the program. (The answer names the holder by his user number on the other machine, which is why it is not given to a login that cannot lock.) Inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION` it works for a `write` definition: it changes nothing, so a rollback has nothing to undo. Under `MUSTLOCK` the check "do I hold the lock?" is this same request, so for a login without the write group it is refused too: the write ends with `STATUS()` 7000 instead of 3023, and nothing is written. A lost connection stops the program with message 12502.

**`GETLOCKS(f, user)`** (internal programs only) of a remote file is the **local view**, as in openQM: the locks of a remote file are held on the other machine and do not appear in this machine's lock table, in `LIST.READU` or in `GETLOCKS()`. It returns the one field of three numbers (`NUMLOCKS`, the number of record locks held on this machine, the peak) and **no lock line**, whatever the user number, and it asks the other machine nothing. To see who holds what on the other machine, look there (`LIST.READU`, which an administrator of that machine can run).

## Administering a remote file

These do on the other machine what they do on a local file, **for your remote login and in the account that login entered there**, so every switch that account has on that machine applies (a file named `voc`, `*.bp` or `*.dic` still needs `voc.edit`, `bp.edit` or `dict.edit` there). They need **three things**, the last on the other machine: a `write` definition here, the remote login in the other machine's write group, **and** in its administration group (`modify.account <account> files-admin-on`; it needs `files-on` and `files-write-on` first and is off for every account until the administrator of that machine gives it).

| | |
|---|---|
| `WRITE rec TO f CREATING.SEQKEY id`, `WRITEU ...` | the other machine's **own counter for that file** gives the id and it comes back in `id`; the update lock on the new record is held there for `WRITEU` and given back for `WRITE`. A directory file is refused as it is locally (message 12353). Not inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION` (message 12515) |
| `FCONTROL(f, key {, value})` | goes to the other machine with its key (`FC$SET.SEQ.KEY`, `FC$GET.SEQ.KEY`, `FC$VALID.ID`, `FC$MINMOD`) and returns what it returned; `STATUS()` is what it left there. Asking whether a name is a valid record id (key 6) changes nothing, every other key is a change |
| `ANALYSE.FILE`, `CONFIGURE.FILE`, `CREATE.INDEX`, `BUILD.INDEX`, `DELETE.INDEX`, `DISABLE.INDEX` on the VOC name of a remote file | run **on the other machine**, as the remote login's Windows user; **what the verb printed there is printed here**, and the verb's return code is the one the other machine's verb ended with. The file is the one the pointer opened (you cannot name another), and the rest of the command is passed on as it stands |
| `CREATE.FILE name ... SERVER srv {AS remote}` | makes the file on server *srv* (as *remote* there when `AS` is given) and, **only after that machine has confirmed it**, writes the `N` pointer *name* in your VOC: there is never a pointer to a file that is not there. `DICT`, `DATA`, `USING`, `PATHNAME`, a comment, `MULTIFILE` and `KEEPCASE` mean nothing for a remote file and are refused (message 12533) before anything is sent; a name already in your VOC is refused (12544) before anything is sent; `voc.edit` is needed because the pointer is a VOC entry |
| `DELETE.FILE name` where *name* is an `N` pointer | asks, as a local delete does (`NO.QUERY` does not), deletes the file on the other machine and, in the same act, the pointer here. If that machine says the file is not there (someone removed it) the pointer would dangle, so the verb offers to remove it (`NO.QUERY` removes it). If that machine refuses, the pointer stays |

**What the other machine accepts in the words.** Letters, digits and `. _ -`, single blanks, at most 200 characters. `PATHNAME`, `LPTR`, `FORCE`, `NO.QUERY`, a slash, a quote or two blanks in a row are refused with message 12535 and nothing is run; `DIRECTORY` is accepted only as the last word. The verb that asks questions is told not to (`CREATE.FILE` and `DELETE.FILE` get `NO.QUERY` there, since you answered here). The index verbs need the file to themselves: if another process has it open on that machine the verb says "Cannot gain exclusive access" and does nothing, as it does locally.

**What it records.** The other machine writes `api admin request=70 op=create.index file=customers user=name` before it runs the verb, and this machine writes `netfile admin server=nfa file=customers op=create.index` (and `netfile fcontrol ... key=n`), so a killed command is still on both trails.

**Not available:** the statements that read or change the tree of an index (`AKREAD`, `AKWRITE`, `AKDELETE`, `CLEAR.AK`, `AKENABLE`, `AKMAP`) on a remote file are still refused (message 12516), as are `OPENSEQ` and the other sequential-file statements. A change is never sent twice: a lost reply is message 12514, and the program must look at the file to find out what happened.

## Indices of a remote file

A remote file's indices are the other machine's, and the statements that *query* them work on a remote file the way they do on a local one. They change nothing, so they need no write definition, no administration group and no gate of their own: a program that may open the file may use them, on a read definition as well as a write one, and inside `BEGIN TRANSACTION`.

| Statement | What it does on a remote file |
|---|---|
| `INDICES(f)`, `INDICES(f, name)` | the names of the indices of the file on the other machine, and the description of one (null for a name that is not an index) |
| `SELECTINDEX name FROM f TO n` | the indexed values, as a select list; `STATUS()` 1 and an empty list for an index that is not there |
| `SELECTINDEX name, value FROM f TO n` | the ids that hold the value; `STATUS()` 0 and an empty list for a value nobody holds |
| `SETLEFT name FROM f`, `SETRIGHT name FROM f` | put the scan at the left (lowest) or the right (highest) end |
| `SELECTRIGHT name FROM f SETTING key TO n`, `SELECTLEFT ...` | the next key to the right (or left) of the scan, in `key`, with its ids as the select list; `STATUS()` 1 and nothing when there is no further key |

The other machine keeps the position of a scan *for the open file*, so `SETLEFT` followed by `SELECTRIGHT` walks the keys in order, and `SELECTINDEX name, value` followed by `SELECTRIGHT` goes on from that value, as locally. Each call is one request (a scan that finds a key makes a second one to fetch its ids), so a scan is as slow as the line between the machines. A lost connection stops the statement with message 12502, as a lost `SELECT` does; these statements have no `ON ERROR` clause.

The `INDICES()` that every query asks of every file now gets the other machine's answer, so `LIST`, `COUNT` and `SELECT ... WITH` on a remote file use the other machine's index when the field in the `WITH` clause has one, and read only the records the index names instead of every record. A file with no index is read as before.

## The 2-second cache

A process keeps the last 64 records it `READ` from remote files for **2 seconds**, and also the fact that the server did not have a record. A second `READ` of the same record from the same file variable in that time is answered from memory, so a `READ` can show a record up to 2 seconds old. A record over 32,768 bytes is not kept; `READV` is not cached; a handle that can write is not cached at all.

## Ids and case

Ids that differ only in case are two records in a directory file and one in a dynamic file, as on a local file, so a program that is moved from a local file to a remote one keeps the behaviour of the kind of file it is. An id holding one of the five mark bytes (251 to 255) is refused by a `WRITE`. These are the server's rules for the file it opens; the pointer adds only the 63-character limit above.

## A program that tells the refusals apart

```
   open 'customers' to f else crt 'OPEN FAILED, STATUS() ':status() ; stop
   oc = 'then'
   write 'viaremote' to f, 'n1' on error oc = 'error'
   if oc = 'error' then
      begin case
         case status() = 7000 ; crt 'refused or lost: read the record to find out which'
         case 1 ; crt 'STATUS() ':status()
      end case
   end
   close f
```

Try every change and lock with `ON ERROR` and print the branch and `STATUS()`: a refusal is then told from a success by what the program prints and by the other machine's file and audit trail, never by the absence of an error.

## What has been run

On Windows, the statements above are compiled and the free checks pass. The test of a stored login's access list was run against real Windows access lists. **Nothing on this page has been run against another server from a Windows machine**, so the table of what a refusal looks like is read from the source and from the Linux version, not seen.
