Title: The Shared Account
Subtitle: Files that every account can open by name, without logto or a pointer: how they are found, who may change them, and what it does not protect.

The installer makes one group account named **`shared`**. **The data files in it can be opened by
every account by file name**: `open "inventory"` in any account finds the file `shared` holds
under that name, when the account has no entry of its own for it. There is no `logto` and no
pointer to make in the account's VOC, and `list`, `sort`, `select`, `count` and a BASIC program's
`open` all find it the same way.

> **Anything in `shared` can be read by every account that has `shared.read`, and `shared.read`
> is ON for every account until you turn it off.** It is the one switch in SD whose blank means
> on. Put nothing in `shared` that is not meant for everyone, and take the right away
> (`modify.account` *name* `shared-read-off`) from an account that should not have it **before**
> you fill the account. Writing is the other way: it is off until you turn it on.

This page is the full description. **Not yet seen to work on a real installation** (see the end of
the page).

## The switches

| word | on `modify.account` *name* | on `create.account user` *name* |
|---|---|---|
| `shared-read-off` | withdraws the right to open the shared files by name | starts the account without it |
| `shared-read-on` | gives it back | not needed (it is the default) |
| `shared-write-on` | lets the account save, delete and clear records in the shared files | starts the account with it |
| `shared-write-off` | takes it away | not needed (it is the default) |

The two switches are fields 13 and 14 of the account's register record, written as `yes` or `no`
for an account made from this release on. **A blank `shared.read` means ON; a blank `shared.write`
means off.** So an account that existed before this release can open the shared files by name and
cannot write them, and nothing is written to the existing accounts when SD is upgraded. A group or
other account takes the words as well. After a change the report line is
"Account *name* has shared.read yes, shared.write no". A switch takes effect at the person's next
entry to an account: at sign-on, at `logto` and at each API entry.

## What it is, on disk

| | |
|---|---|
| the account | a group account named `shared`; its register record is `accounts\shared` in the SDSYS directory |
| its directory | `C:\ProgramData\SD\group_accounts\shared` |
| the directory's access list | SYSTEM and Administrators: Full control. `sdusers`: Modify. Both inherited by the files and folders below it, and nothing else is granted (inheritance from the data folder is broken) |
| its Windows group | **`sdg_shared`**, which has **no members** |
| the register's group field | `sdg_shared` |

**Why the group is not `sdusers`.** Signing on to an account, `logto` and a Q-pointer admit exactly
the members of the register's group (and an elevated administrator). If that were `sdusers`, every SD
user could `logto shared` and write there whatever `shared.write` said, and taking `shared.read`
away would stop nothing. With `sdg_shared`, which nobody belongs to, only an administrator signed on
elevated enters `shared`; everybody else reaches its files only through the lookup below, which is
what the two switches control. The files themselves are open to `sdusers` so that every SD user's
own process can read them through the kernel and, with `shared.write`, write them.

SDSYS puts files in `shared` the way it works in any account: `logto shared`, then `create.file`,
`copy`, a program that writes, and so on. Making and changing the *structure* of a file is SDSYS's
alone (below).

**The name is reserved.** `create.account` refuses it, with or without a type
("The account name shared is reserved for the shared account, which the installer makes: it cannot
be created, restored or attached by hand"), and `delete.account shared` is refused ("The shared
account cannot be deleted"). The installer makes the account with a one-time marker that it removes
whatever happens. If an account named `shared` already exists when the installer is run and is not
SD's own (its register record does not say `C:\ProgramData\SD\group_accounts\shared` on line 1 and
`sdg_shared` on line 3), **the install stops before it changes anything** and names the record.
Move that account aside by hand (its register record under `sdsys\accounts` and its directory) and
run the installer again. The installer leaves a log of what it did in `make-shared.log` in the data
folder.

**An upgrade keeps the directory's access list.** The installer's per-account re-stamp, which runs
at every install, knows the name `shared` and gives its directory `sdusers` Modify rather than
`sdg_shared`; without that the next install would lock every user out of the shared files.

## How a name is found

An `open` of a name looks, in this order, at:

1. **The account's own VOC.** Its entry, however the case is typed, always wins. So do the
   `PATH:` and *account*`:`*file* forms. Nothing about `shared` is looked at when the account has
   its own entry.
2. **Whether the lookup applies at all.** Only an `open` follows `shared` — a file `open`
   (data, or `open dict`). `openseq`, `deleteseq` and `call "file prog"` never do. The
   session must not be the local administrator, must have `shared.read` on, and must not have asked
   for a `name,component` form.
3. **The shape of the name.** 1 to 63 characters; the first a letter or a digit, the rest letters,
   digits or one of `. _ - $`. **A name that begins with `$ & ! * _` or `%` is never looked
   up**, which keeps `$savedlists`, `$hold` and every `&...&` file each account's own.
4. **The standard VOC.** A name that is in the standard VOC (`md`, `sd.accounts` and the like) is
   never looked up.
5. **The register record of `shared`.** It must exist, must not be suspended, and must hold an
   absolute path. A suspended or missing `shared` shares nothing.
6. **`shared`'s own VOC.** It must hold the name as an **F** entry (a file pointer), and not a
   multifile. Q, N, V, K, X and every other kind of entry are never followed.
7. **The pathname field** of that entry (the dictionary's field for `open dict`): no `@` token,
   and a relative name is taken from `shared`'s directory.
8. **The kernel's test of the path.** The file must exist and lie strictly *inside* `shared`'s
   directory, and no part of the path below the directory may be a VOC, a program file
   (`bp`, `bp.out`, `*.bp`, `*.bp.out`), a dictionary (except the one asked for) or
   `shared`'s private catalogue. A pointer in `shared`'s VOC to a file anywhere else is refused.
9. **The audit line**, once for each name in a session, after the name has been accepted.

A refusal at any step is not a message: the name is simply not there, and the `open` takes its
`else` branch as it would for any missing file. Files are locked exactly as in any account, so two
accounts opening the same shared file see each other's record locks. A session that came in over the
network (the API) is held by the kernel to its own account's folder as well; the shared folder is the
one other place it is let into, when it has `shared.read`.

### What is not shared

The **VOC, verbs, sentences, paragraphs, catalogue and programs of `shared` are never reached from
another account.** Only data files, and their dictionaries, are shared. A program kept in `shared`
is not run from another account by name, and `shared`'s `voc` and `bp` cannot be opened as data by
any name. The administrator's own `open` does not follow `shared` either: SDSYS reaches the files
with `logto shared`.

## Who may do what

| the session | read by name | save, delete or clear records | write a dictionary | change the structure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| an account with `shared.read` on (the default) | yes | no — refused | no | no |
| `shared.read` and `shared.write` on | yes | yes | only if `dict-on` too | no |
| `shared.read` off | not found | — | — | no |
| the SDSYS session (`logto shared`, signed on at a terminal) | — | yes | yes | **yes** |
| a member of `sdg_shared`, in `logto shared` | — | only if the account `shared` has `shared-write-on` | likewise | no |

* **A record write** — `write`, `writev`, `matwrite`, `delete`, `clearfile`, and the verbs that save
  into a file the user names (`copy ... to`, `ed`, `copyp`, `save.list` and the rest) — needs
  `shared.write`. Without it SD says "A file in the shared account can only be changed by an account
  that has shared.write (SDSYS can give it: modify.account *account* shared-write-on)".
* **A shared dictionary** needs `shared.write` **and** the sign-on account's `dict-on`. A write
  with `dict-on` and without `shared.write` is refused for `shared.write`; with `shared.write` and
  without `dict-on`, for the dictionary.
* **Structure** means making a file by pathname inside `shared`, `clear.file`,
  `configure.file`, `create.index`, `build.index`, `delete.index`, `set.trigger`, the setters of
  `fcontrol`, renaming and deleting a file or directory. It is refused to everyone who is not the
  administrator signed on at a terminal, **for a program marked internal as well, whatever switches
  the account has**: "The structure of a file in the shared account (making, clearing, configuring,
  indexing, triggers, renaming or deleting it) can only be changed by SDSYS, signed on at a terminal".
  Writing a record to an indexed shared file by someone who has `shared.write` still keeps the index.
* **A maintainer who is not SDSYS** is a member of `sdg_shared` (`modify.account shared add`
  *name*) on an account where `shared-write-on` has been given to the account **`shared`** itself.
  Inside `logto shared` the switches are the account `shared`'s own record; a blank means write
  off. A maintainer changes records, never structure.
* **The administrator** is never refused a record write or a structure change, and is not given
  the by-name lookup (it uses `logto shared`).
* **`basic`** writes an object file by name, so compiling a source that lies in `shared` needs the
  rights to write there; without `shared.write` the compile is refused and nothing is written.

## The audit trail

The first time a session opens each shared name, one line is written, in lower case:

```
shared open file=inventory
```

A second open of the same name in the session writes nothing, and a refused name writes nothing.
The administrator's words are the usual `modify.account shared-read-off account=fred` and its
siblings. Refusals are not audited.

## `list.shared`

```
list.shared
```

`list.shared` lists, one to a line, the names of the files of `shared` that an account with
`shared.read` can open by name, then a count: "Files of the shared account that can be opened by
name: 3". A name is listed only if the lookup above would accept it. It changes nothing and writes no
audit line. It is in SDSYS's set, not in an ordinary account's VOC; if it is put in one, an account
with `shared.read` off is told "Account *name* has shared.read off, so it cannot open the files of
the shared account by name" and sees nothing. When there is no `shared` account in service, or it
is suspended, it says "There is no shared account in service".

## Cautions

1. **Every account with `shared.read` can read everything the lookup reaches.** A file is open to
   all as soon as it has an **F** entry in `shared`'s VOC. A file in the directory with no entry
   in the VOC is not found by name.
2. **An SD program marked internal that opens a file by name could be handed a shared file in
   the place of the account's own** (SD's own internal programs open system files such as
   `$savedlists` and `$hold` by name, on behalf of the account that ran them). That is the
   confused-deputy case, and it is why a name that begins with a symbol, and every name in the
   standard VOC, is never looked up: a file in `shared` called `$hold` would not be found. A name
   that begins with a letter or a digit is a name any account may open, so choose the names in
   `shared`'s VOC knowing that.
3. **A plain `list` still writes the compiled form of a new I-type into the dictionary it reads.**
   That is an SD program writing on the account's behalf, and it is let through on a shared
   dictionary for an account without `shared.write`. The data is not touched.
4. **An account with `sh-on` or `os-on` reaches the files at the operating-system level.** The files
   are open to `sdusers`, so a shell can read them, and with `shared.read` off that account still
   can; the switch is a wall for an account that has neither of the two, not for one that does.
5. **Withdrawal takes effect at the person's next entry.** `shared.read` is tested when a file
   is opened: a file already open stays usable until the person signs off or enters another
   account. `shared.write` is tested at every write.
6. **The API's `sdsys` login is not given the shared files.** The API is never open to SDSYS on
   Windows, so the rule Linux has for it does not exist here.

## What is not done

* `shared` is not replicated to other servers.
* The programs of `shared` are not shared: there is no catalogue of shared programs.
* Every `open` that misses the account's own VOC for an ordinary lower-case name now reads the
  register and `shared`'s VOC to see; nothing caches a miss yet. Names that begin with a symbol and
  the standard names never reach the disk.
* SD Core Solo has one account, and does not have this.
* **Not yet seen to work on a real installation:** the installer's creation of the account, the
  access list of the directory, the lookup and the switches in a live session, and the network entry.
  The decisions in the installer's scripts (the preflight, the access-list check, the re-stamp rule)
  have been run against test folders.
